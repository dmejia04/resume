        <h3 class="section-title">INTECOCIS Project</h3>
        	<p>The <a class="link" href="http://intecocis.inp-toulouse.fr/en/home.html">INTECOCIS</a> project was issued from an <a class="link" href="https://erc.europa.eu/advanced-grants">ERC</a> european advanced grand obtained by <a class="link" href="http://www.cerfacs.fr/~poinsot/">Dr. Thierry Poinsot</a> and his team in 2013. This project is dedicated to the study of combustion instabilities using massively parallel computing on the largest world systems. My role in this project was to build and test an experimental rig to serve as a validation tool for the advanced computational simulations. This experimental rig is called INTRIG and is a controlled buff-body type combustion chamber with well defined boundary conditions. The INTRIG burner has constant rectangular cross section and feature a V-shape laminar premixed flame anchor at the a flame holder.<!-- The main componenet of the combustion chamber is a cylindrical (94 mm long and 8 mm diameter) flame holder-->. The design of the combustion chamber allows the flame holder to have different characteristics and shapes <i>e.g.</i> it can be cooled or heated in order to study the effec of heat transfer on flame dynamics and flame stabilisation. It can also be rotated or vibrated in order to study different flame stabilisations mechanism.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Slot Burner Project</h3>	
        	<p>The slot burner project was financed by a "bource ministerielle" and it was issued from the basic idea that thermal machines do not perform in the same way during a cold start than in permanente regime. To approach this idea from a fundamental point of view an experimental rig was build. It consist in a bunsen type burner, which features a premixed-laminar flame stabilized over a 10:1 aspect ratio slot. The main characteristic of this burner is that the stability of the system can be controlled by only changes in the flame holder temperature. During the warmup, the system is unstable, it develops a combustion instability looked at its Helmholtz resonate frequency. This instability can reach acoustic noise levels up to 150 dB, depending on the operating conditions. At the permanent regime, when the flame holder has reached is equilibrium temperature, the system is stable. This study was the first controlled experiment that put in evidence the importance the heat transfer on the study of combustion instabilities. In order to capture the correct flame dynamics. Thus, to predict combustion instabilities with numerical simulations or analytical models. It is necessary take into account the heat transfer from the flame to the combustion chamber, specially to the flame holder.</p>
        	<p>The following video shows the slot burner in operation, here, the temperature of the flame holder is controlled by varying the mass-flow rate of water that passes through the flame holder cooling system.</p>
