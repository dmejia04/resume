                    <p>Within the combustion laboratory of the PSC group at the <a class="link" href="https://www.imft.fr">IMFT</a> I was responsable for the development of a new experimental bench for the study of flame dynamics and flame stabilization. This combustion chamber was designed in order to serve as a validation tool for the advanced CFD computational simulations performed in the <a class="link" href="http://intecocis.inp-toulouse.fr/en/home.html">INTECOCIS</a> project. I was also responsable for carring-out tests campaigns in their entirety: preparation, monitoring and control, post-processing and analysis. I was also in charge of synthesizing the experimental results, post-processing the corresponding CFD numerical simulations and comparing them in order to write scientific papers. The experimental tests included several advanced measuring techniques such as PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry), LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry), LIP (Laser Induced Phosphorescence), laser tomography, infrared thermography and hight speed imaginary. This results were presented in several publications in the leading scientific journals of the field. The different task I performed were:</p>
                    <ul class="taskPostdoc">
                        <li>Draft design of the combustion chamber in Catia and supervise its manufacturing at the IMFT workshop.</li> 
                        <li>Choose and buy the technical equipment,</li>
                        <li>Design a LabView platform for the control of the burner as well as a plataform for the synchronization of the different measurement equipements.</li> 
                        <li>Design of a PID controller for the servocotrol of brusshless DC motor used for the active control of combustion instabilities in the combustion chamber.</li>

                    <p>Performed in the PSC group of the <a class="link" href="https://www.imft.fr">IMFT</a> laboratory. I specialized in combustion physics and heat transfert. The study focuses on combustion instabilities (CI's). CI's, induced by the resonant coupling of acoustics and combustion occur in many practical systems such as domestic boilers, gas turbine and rocket engines. They produce pressure and heat release fluctuations that in some extreme cases can provoke mechanical failure or catastrophic damage. These phenomena have been extensively studied in the past, and the basic driving and coupling mechanisms have already been identified. However, it is well known that most systems behave differently at cold start and in the permanent regime and the coupling between the temperature of the solid material and combustion instabilities still remains unclear. The aim of this thesis is to study this mechanism.</p>
                    <p>This work presents an analytical and experimental investigation of combustion instabilities for a laminar premixed flame stabilized on a slot burner with controlled wall temperature. For certain operating conditions, the system exhibits a combustion instability locked on the Helmholtz mode of the burner. It is shown that this instability can be controlled and even suppressed by changing solely the temperature of the burner rim. A linear stability analysis is used to identify the parameters playing a role in the resonant coupling and retrieves the features observed experimentally. Detailed experimental studies of the different elementary processes involved in the thermo-acoustic coupling are used to evaluate the sensitivity of these parameters to the wall temperature. Finally a theoretical model of unsteady heat transfer from the flame root to the burner-rim and detailed experimental measurements permit to establish the physical mechanism for the temperature dependance on the flame response.</p>
